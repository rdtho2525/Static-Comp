          <p>Years at the Company: 30 years</p>
          <p>As a child, Michael worked at Bluth's Original Frozen Banana Stand. 
          Either in college or shortly after graduating, Michael began working for his father at the Bluth Company. 
          He put in an honest day's work and never stole from the company, 
          unlike the rest of his family. His father was impressed by his work ethic but he constantly shot his son 
          down to keep working hard for his approval.</p>

          <p>George Bluth founded the Bluth Company in 1953 and proceeded to grow it into a real

            systematically replaced the entire staff with younger, cheaper employees, 
            and worked with Saddam Hussein for a quick buck. </p>
